# Magazine CMS Gemini Agent Context

This document provides context for the Gemini agent to understand and interact with the Magazine CMS project.

## Development Scope

All development work should be performed locally. There should be no interaction with remote databases or services.

## Git

Use git to manage the code. Please create commits often. Feel free to start up any web servers you need to test along the way.

## Tech Stack

Feel free to use whatever tech stack makes sense for building a reusable tool. But take care to make sure that the outputs the tool generates are in accordance with the prompt in PROMPT.md.
